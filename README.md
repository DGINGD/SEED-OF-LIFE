# SEED-OF-LIFE
i would like a lot of help to bring this next project to life.
if we could design stuff on a game like having a 3 d printer inside the coding of the game 
then when something is needed it can be reverse engineered in the game and designed by a 3 d printed real part virtually real that is
imagine walking up to a machine and talking normal to it say hey i have an issue with finding a part for x item you set 
the scanner near the missing item and it laser scans the needed part area and to the best of its ability it will redesign until optimum
performance can be achieved i mean really now we can 3d print most anything now why not put it to a ability test digitally first start 
building new inventions that do not create polution or carbon emmissions zero emmissions zero fuels zero toxins and start healing 
our world one day at a time one carbon monoxide over writing machine i have many ideas in this area and the knowledge to carry such adventure 
out all exept for one issue i dont have the finacial backing to create such devices in real life so i thought about designing a program to bridge 
the gap in our society. nope no fingers pointed at anyone not even myself but we now have the power to start healing our world not destroying it
trying to learn about our solar system and spending mega billions on ideas that are only killing us over time 
if we dont start the change right now then we wont have kids to raise in the future cause cancer is going to take us all out if not it will probably be something 
we bring back from another planet like mars ..... hence the name martian isnt that where we got the name martian from 
what if we have the power right now to accomplish this but we are too blinded by filling our pockets with green instead of being kind and considerate 
the sad fact is we are all selfish as fuck even i am almost 99 percent of the time im focused on trying to accomplish something from nothing 
i have gotten to a point in my life where it is no longer ok to me to just keep trudging when we are supposed to be free americans We live in 
home of the free the proud the brave ..... then theres the other .... the homeless, the selfish, the greedy grinches, the bah humbugs of the loving spirit 
we all possess if you have life you have a soul and you are important to many if you so choose to sand up and say i have had enough. the rich get richer the poor get poorer
but really what are we working all our lives to achieve these days work for 40 years then retire and live on pennies of a dollar if your able to retire before y
you catch cancer get run over by a drunk or get ate by these mindless mentally challenged people we have . i believe it is because of the way we grown up recently 
they took certain things out of certain places and then where there was one thing some wanted something else so the way we are headed seems to repeat the
cycle of life that we all return to the earth no matter our accomplishments so what can we say we accomplished if we dont love other people enough to help them 
off drugs and get them help for the traumatic events that may have happened long ago in there past ..... the reason im bringing this up is to point out my own 
trauma from my childhood i was raped and molested by a sibling for 5 yrs strait to the point i would get so impacted and throw my food up and even pooped in my pants
when i was a child cause my gape was so big i couldnt sqeeze my cheeks together hard enough to stop leakage i would get screamed at when i pooped myself i would try to go
take a bath and there was my elder party to help me take a bath cause mom said i pooped myself. well enough about the trauma i could go on for a year with everything that is still very vivid in my mind
to this day i cant connect with people cause i spent so much time isolating myself for comfort and protection to stay away from everyone i would sleep at the 
foot of my mothers bed she was always high on pills nd still is to this day you name it she has taken it if the mix is right and she can be comfertable she will
take it my father would always leave his beer on the table after he fell asleep he would only drink the first beer and the second one he would take a sip put it 
down then fall asleep in his recliner i would sneek up and drink the beer thinking it was water  o yea did i mention i also have had one of my ears removed when
i was 10 so they could patch a hole in my ear drum not to mention all the times they poured god knows what in it to try not taking me to the doctor
i was very timid and did what i was told when i was told i been that way all my life but the problem with that is now the timid tends to make people shy away from
me so i am starting to realize it is not everyone else that has the problem it is me because of the events that took place in my past my mind is forever stuck at 
that point in my learning curve where i developed real human connection without abuse of some type when i asked my mom who my father was she kind of laughed and
said he is the worst piece of trash i have ever met and he i guess would you say lived up to the hype i have experienced great pain and i have experienced great pleasure
sad part about me is all i need is some really amazing people that i have in my life now and around me my circle is super small at the
moment but i am needing help getting in the right directions with my thought patterns my overall health is starting to decline because of the torture i have
put this earthly dirt of a shell with blood inside through. but i want to say this through it all every time i have been blessed by God in the sense each situation i 
have ever been in even when i felt i was dead he was right there holding me like no one else could ever even get close to me or my heart when i was two years old i have this
memorie being set outside in alabama with a foot of snow on the ground and i was in a diaper my mom set me on the snow cause i wouldnt stop screaming cause i had
the hole in my ear drum when she sat me down and closed the door i remember a great blinding light coming from out of the sky it created around me a warm circle and even melted
the snow around me and i was laughing the entire time i remember that moment i met my savior his name was   GOD and he said he loved me very much and that i would 
suffer many things but to always do what people told me and by doing so it would honor him what else could i do but completly be a 2 yr old and how can i remember all the things we talked about
all those years i seemed to drift away waiting on him to return one day although i knew he was always right there thats why i usually stay so calm even when i am all jacked up i spent twenty years shooting meth
in my veins smoking it constantly eating it keefering it, hot railing it, drinking meth as a liquid right after its sythesized in a beaker i know some dumb ass chemistry learned how to make the stuff
while protecting the very people yall think are doing you so much harm. its not the drugs its not the beer its not the liquir its not any drug on the market 
that can make me kill someone that just wont happen some of these people running around commiting crimes because they know they gonna get three hots and a cot doesnt matter what they have to do to get there
they have more power in the system turn criminal go to jail get fucked by big bubba then become an even more horid monster than the one who did it to them 
what else you gonna do while you spending life behind bars the only support you will get in a place like that is from God at that place the gaurds do not care they 
have family to go home to ....then another twist mobsters get in touch with outsiders via cell phones smuggled in and threaten to do stuff to people they know or blackmail 
by people throwing packs over the wall and having someone mule it in they wrap stuff up and swallow it go commit a crime so they can deliver the drugs inside the walls of prison you can get more drugs inside
than outside i have said all that to bring this to everyones attention elon musk is killing us trying to go to space the fuel dispersion is so caustic and volitile
